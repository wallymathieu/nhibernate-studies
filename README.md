nhibernate-studies
==================

Old code based on Summer Of NHibernate. The old code was a bit dated, so here is the updated version.

## Intro
In order to help with self studies of NHibernate I've created this sample project. 

The code is a heavily modified fork of the code from Summer Of NHibernate:
http://summerofnhibernate.com/
So, there is nothing really special about this project.

I've used SQLite in order to have maximum portability between databases. People have mentioned that with the use of SQLite you can write your datacentric tests against a fresh test database. It looks as if the NHibernate people have supported the use of a ordinary test database as well, something that I imagine can be very useful.
